You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

dateFashion(5, 10) → 2
dateFashion(5, 2) → 0
dateFashion(5, 5) → 1


The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean isSummer, return true if the squirrels play and false otherwise.

squirrelPlay(95, false) → false
squirrelPlay(95, true) → true


You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2.

caughtSpeeding(65, false) → 1
caughtSpeeding(65, true) → 0

Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".

alarmClock(1, false) → "7:00"
alarmClock(5, false) → "7:00"
alarmClock(0, false) → "10:00"


The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, return true if either one is 6. Or if their sum or difference is 6. Note: the function Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

answerCell(false, false, true) → false
answerCell(true, false, false) → false


We are having a party with amounts of tea and candy. Return the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great. A party is good (1) if both tea and candy are at least 5. However, if either tea or candy is at least double the amount of the other one, the party is great (2). However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party is always bad (0).

inOrderEqual(5, 7, 6, false) → false
inOrderEqual(5, 5, 7, true) → true

withoutDoubles(2, 3, true) → 5
withoutDoubles(3, 3, true) → 7
withoutDoubles(3, 3, false) → 6


Given two int values, return whichever value is larger. However if the two values have the same remainder when divided by 5, then the return the smaller value. However, in all cases, if the two values are the same, return 0. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 7 % 5 is 2.

maxMod5(2, 3) → 3
maxMod5(6, 2) → 6
maxMod5(3, 2) → 3


You have a red lottery ticket showing ints a, b, and c, each of which is 0, 1, or 2. If they are all the value 2, the result is 10. Otherwise if they are all the same, the result is 5. Otherwise so long as both b and c are different from a, the result is 1. Otherwise the result is 0.

redTicket(2, 2, 2) → 10
redTicket(2, 2, 1) → 0
redTicket(0, 0, 0) → 5


You have a green lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. If the numbers are all different from each other, the result is 0. If all of the numbers are the same, the result is 20. If two of the numbers are the same, the result is 10.

greenTicket(2, 2, 2) → 20
greenTicket(1, 1, 2) → 10


You have a blue lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. This makes three pairs, which we'll call ab, bc, and ac. Consider the sum of the numbers in each pair. If any pair sums to exactly 10, the result is 10. Otherwise if the ab sum is exactly 10 more than either bc or ac sums, the result is 5. Otherwise the result is 0.

blueTicket(9, 1, 0) → 10
blueTicket(9, 2, 0) → 0
blueTicket(6, 1, 4) → 10


Given two ints, each in the range 10..99, return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as the 2 in 12 and 23. (Note: division, e.g. n/10, gives the left digit while the % "mod" n%10 gives the right digit.)

shareDigit(12, 43) → false
shareDigit(12, 44) → false


Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)

loneSum(3, 2, 3) → 2
loneSum(3, 3, 3) → 0


Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is 13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.

luckySum(1, 2, 3) → 6
luckySum(1, 2, 13) → 3
luckySum(1, 13, 3) → 1


Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "public int fixTeen(int n) {"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main noTeenSum().

noTeenSum(1, 2, 3) → 6
noTeenSum(2, 13, 1) → 3
noTeenSum(2, 1, 14) → 3


For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().

roundSum(16, 17, 18) → 60
roundSum(12, 13, 14) → 30
roundSum(6, 4, 4) → 10


Given three ints, a b c, return true if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

closeFar(1, 2, 10) → true
closeFar(1, 2, 3) → false
closeFar(4, 1, 3) → true


Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 without going over. Return 0 if they both go over.

blackjack(21, 19) → 21
blackjack(19, 22) → 19


Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.

evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false

catDog("catcat") → false
catDog("1cat1cadodog") → true

countCode("codexxcode") → 2
countCode("cozexxcope") → 2


Given two strings, return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring upper/lower case differences (in other words, the computation should not be "case sensitive"). Note:  str.toLowerCase() returns the lowercase version of a string.

endOther("Hiabc", "abc") → true
endOther("AbC", "HiaBc") → true
endOther("abc", "abXabc") → true


Return true if the given string contains an appearance of "xyz" where the xyz is not directly preceeded by a period (.). So "xxyz" counts but "x.xyz" does not.

xyzThere("abcxyz") → true
xyzThere("abc.xyz") → false
xyzThere("xyz.abc") → true


Return true if the given string contains a "bob" string, but where the middle 'o' char can be any char.

bobThere("b9b") → true
bobThere("bac") → false


We'll say that a String is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' chars in the string, there exists a 'y' char somewhere later in the string. So "xxy" is balanced, but "xyx" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's. Return true if the given string is xy-balanced.

prefixAgain("abXYabc", 1) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 2) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 3) → false


Given a string, does "xyz" appear in the middle of the string? To define middle, we'll say that the number of chars to the left and right of the "xyz" must differ by at most one. This problem is harder than it looks.

xyzMiddle("AAxyzBB") → true
xyzMiddle("AxyzBB") → true
xyzMiddle("AxyzBBB") → false


A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between. Return the string that is between the first and last appearance of "bread" in the given string, or return the empty string "" if there are not two pieces of bread.

sameStarChar("xy*yzz") → true
sameStarChar("xy*zzz") → false
sameStarChar("*xa*az") → true


Given a string, compute a new string by moving the first char to come after the next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars, so "abcdef" yields "bcaefd". Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end.

oneTwo("abc") → "bca"
oneTwo("tca") → "cat"
oneTwo("tcagdo") → "catdog"


Look for patterns like "zip" and "zap" in the string -- length-3, starting with 'z' and ending with 'p'. Return a string where for all such words, the middle letter is gone, so "zipXzap" yields "zpXzp".

zipZap("zipXzap") → "zpXzp"
zipZap("zopzop") → "zpzp"
zipZap("zzzopzop") → "zzzpzp"


Return a version of the given string, where for every star (*) in the string the star and the chars immediately to its left and right are gone. So "ab*cd" yields "ad" and "ab**cd" also yields "ad".

starOut("ab*cd") → "ad"
starOut("ab**cd") → "ad"
starOut("sm*eilly") → "silly"


None

wordEnds("XY123XY", "XY") → "13"
wordEnds("XY1XY", "XY") → "11"


Given a string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -- so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" count, but not the 'y' in "yellow" (not case sensitive). We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is an alphabetic letter.)

countYZ("fez day") → 2
countYZ("day fez") → 2
countYZ("day fyyyz") → 2

countTriple("xxxabyyyycd") → 3
countTriple("a") → 0


Given a string, return the sum of the digits 0-9 that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters. Return 0 if there are no digits in the string. (Note: Character.isDigit(char) tests if a char is one of the chars '0', '1', .. '9'. Integer.parseInt(string) converts a string to an int.)

sumDigits("aa1bc2d3") → 6
sumDigits("aa11b33") → 8
sumDigits("Chocolate") → 0


Given a string, return the longest substring that appears at both the beginning and end of the string without overlapping. For example, sameEnds("abXab") is "ab".

sameEnds("abXYab") → "ab"
sameEnds("xx") → "x"
sameEnds("xxx") → "x"


Given a string, look for a mirror image (backwards) string at both the beginning and end of the given string. In other words, zero or more characters at the very begining of the given string, and at the very end of the string in reverse order (possibly overlapping). For example, the string "abXYZba" has the mirror end "ab".

mirrorEnds("abXYZba") → "ab"
mirrorEnds("abca") → "a"
mirrorEnds("aba") → "aba"


Given a string, return the length of the largest "block" in the string. A block is a run of adjacent chars that are the same.

maxBlock("hoopla") → 2
maxBlock("abbCCCddBBBxx") → 3
maxBlock("") → 0


Given a string, return the sum of the numbers appearing in the string, ignoring all other characters. A number is a series of 1 or more digit chars in a row. (Note: Character.isDigit(char) tests if a char is one of the chars '0', '1', .. '9'. Integer.parseInt(string) converts a string to an int.)

sumNumbers("abc123xyz") → 123
sumNumbers("aa11b33") → 44
sumNumbers("7 11") → 18


Given a string, return a string where every appearance of the lowercase word "is" has been replaced with "is not". The word "is" should not be immediately preceeded or followed by a letter -- so for example the "is" in "this" does not count. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is a letter.)

notReplace("is test") → "is not test"
notReplace("is-is") → "is not-is not"
notReplace("This is right") → "This is not right"


Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.

bigDiff([2, 10, 7, 2]) → 8


Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

centeredAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
centeredAverage([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
centeredAverage([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3


Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count.

sum13([1, 1]) → 2
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13]) → 6

Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array.

shiftLeft([6, 2, 5, 3]) → [2, 5, 3, 6]
shiftLeft([1, 2]) → [2, 1]
shiftLeft([1]) → [1]


For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10. So {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5} yields {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}.

post4([4, 4, 1, 2, 3]) → [1, 2, 3]


We'll say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values before and after it, and those values are different from it. Return a version of the given array where every instance of the given value which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or right is larger.

notAlone([1, 2, 3], 2) → [1, 3, 3]

notAlone([3, 4], 3) → [3, 4]


Return an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that all the zeros are grouped at the start of the array. The order of the non-zero numbers does not matter. So {1, 0, 0, 1} becomes {0 ,0, 1, 1}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

zeroFront([1, 0, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1]
zeroFront([0, 1, 1, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
zeroFront([1, 0]) → [0, 1]


Return a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces a the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) → [2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) → [1, 99, 0]

Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)

maxSpan([1, 2, 1, 1, 3]) → 4
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4]) → 6
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]) → 6


Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 3 is immediately followed by a 4. Do not move the 3's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 3's and 4's, every 3 has a number after it that is not a 3, and a 3 appears in the array before any 4.

fix34([1, 3, 1, 4]) → [1, 3, 4, 1]
fix34([1, 3, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1]) → [1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4]
fix34([3, 2, 2, 4]) → [3, 4, 2, 2]


(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array.

fix45([5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]) → [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5]) → [1, 4, 5, 1]

squareUp(3) → [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
squareUp(2) → [0, 1, 2, 1]
squareUp(4) → [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]


Given n>=0, create an array with the pattern {1,    1, 2,    1, 2, 3,   ... 1, 2, 3 .. n} (spaces added to show the grouping). Note that the length of the array will be 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n, which is known to sum to exactly n*(n + 1)/2.

seriesUp(3) → [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
seriesUp(4) → [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]
seriesUp(2) → [1, 1, 2]


We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.

maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1]) → 3
maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) → 3
maxMirror([7, 1, 2, 9, 7, 2, 1]) → 2


Say that a "clump" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.

countClumps([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 2, 1, 1]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) → 1

scoresIncreasing([1, 3, 2]) → false
scoresIncreasing([1, 1, 4]) → true

scores100([1, 100, 99, 100]) → false
scores100([100, 1, 100, 100]) → true


Given an array of scores sorted in increasing order, return true if the array contains 3 adjacent scores that differ from each other by at most 2, such as with {3, 4, 5} or {3, 5, 5}.

scoresClump([3, 4, 5]) → true
scoresClump([3, 4, 6]) → false

wordsFront(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2) → ["a", "b"]
wordsFront(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 3) → ["a", "b", "c"]


Given an array of strings, return a new List (e.g. an ArrayList) where all the strings of the given length are omitted. See wordsWithout() below which is more difficult because it uses arrays.

wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 1) → ["bb", "ccc"]
wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 3) → ["a", "bb", "b"]
wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 4) → ["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"]


Given a positive int n, return true if it contains a 1 digit. Note: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit.

hasOne(10) → true
hasOne(22) → false
hasOne(220) → false


We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides into the number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 evenly. We'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly, so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. Note: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit.

dividesSelf(128) → true
dividesSelf(12) → true
dividesSelf(120) → false


Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length "count" containing the first even numbers from the original array. The original array will contain at least "count" even numbers.

copyEvens([3, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) → [2, 4, 8]
copyEvens([6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) → [6, 2, 4]


We'll say that a positive int n is "endy" if it is in the range 0..10 or 90..100 (inclusive). Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length "count" containing the first endy numbers from the original array. Decompose out a separate isEndy(int n) method to test if a number is endy. The original array will contain at least "count" endy numbers.

copyEndy([9, 11, 90, 22, 6], 2) → [9, 90]
copyEndy([9, 11, 90, 22, 6], 3) → [9, 90, 6]
copyEndy([12, 1, 1, 13, 0, 20], 2) → [1, 1]


Given 2 arrays that are the same length containing strings, compare the 1st string in one array to the 1st string in the other array, the 2nd to the 2nd and so on. Count the number of times that the 2 strings are non-empty and start with the same char. The strings may be any length, including 0.

matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["aaa", "xx", "bb"]) → 1
matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["aaa", "b", "bb"]) → 2
matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["", "", "ccc"]) → 1


The "key" array is an array containing the correct answers to an exam, like {"a", "a", "b", "b"}. the "answers" array contains a student's answers, with "?" representing a question left blank. The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer.

scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "c"]) → 6
scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "a", "b", "c"]) → 11
scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "a", "b", "b"]) → 16


Given an array of strings, return a new array without the strings that are equal to the target string. One approach is to count the occurrences of the target string, make a new array of the correct length, and then copy over the correct strings.

wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "a") → ["b", "c"]
wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "b") → ["a", "c", "a"]
wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "c") → ["a", "b", "a"]


Given two arrays, A and B, of non-negative int scores. A "special" score is one which is a multiple of 10, such as 40 or 90. Return the sum of largest special score in A and the largest special score in B. To practice decomposition, write a separate helper method which finds the largest special score in an array. Write your helper method after your scoresSpecial() method in the JavaBat text area.

scoresSpecial([12, 10, 4], [2, 20, 30]) → 40
scoresSpecial([20, 10, 4], [2, 20, 10]) → 40
scoresSpecial([12, 11, 4], [2, 20, 31]) → 20


We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start index and ending at the end index. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1 + 5 = 6. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.

sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 6
sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 2
sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 11


(A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start index and ending at the end index, however increases in height count double. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1*2 + 5 = 7. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.

sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 7
sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 2
sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 15


(A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the number of "big" steps for a walk starting at the start index and ending at the end index. We'll say that  step is big if it is 5 or more up or down. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.

bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 1
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 0
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 1


We have data for two users, A and B, each with a String name and an int id. The goal is to order the users such as for sorting. Return -1 if A comes before B, 1 if A comes after B, and 0 if they are the same. Order first by the string names, and then by the id numbers if the names are the same. Note: with Strings str1.compareTo(str2) returns an int value which is negative/0/positive to indicate how str1 is ordered to str2 (the value is not limited to -1/0/1). (On the AP, there would be two User objects, but here the code simply takes the two strings and two ints directly. The code logic is the same.)

userCompare("bb", 1, "zz", 2) → -1
userCompare("bb", 1, "aa", 2) → 1
userCompare("bb", 1, "bb", 1) → 0


Start with two arrays of strings, A and B, each with its elements in alphabetical order and without duplicates. Return a new array containing the first N elements from the two arrays. The result array should be in alphabetical order and without duplicates. A and B will both have a length which is N or more. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over A and B, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order, copying elements directly to the new array.

mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["b", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "b", "c"]
mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["c", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "c", "f"]
mergeTwo(["f", "g", "z"], ["c", "f", "g"], 3) → ["c", "f", "g"]


Start with two arrays of strings, a and b, each in alphabetical order, possibly with duplicates. Return the count of the number of strings which appear in both arrays. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order.

commonTwo(["a", "c", "x"], ["b", "c", "d", "x"]) → 2

The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.

fibonacci(0) → 0
fibonacci(1) → 1
fibonacci(2) → 1


We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

We'll say that 2 strings "match" if they are non-empty and their first chars are the same. Loop over and then return the given array of non-empty strings as follows: if a string matches an earlier string in the array, swap the 2 strings in the array.
